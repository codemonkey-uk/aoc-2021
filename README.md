# aoc-2021
Advent Of Code 2021 (Solutions)

This depot is NOT an example of either (a) best practice, (b) optimal or high performance, code.

This depot IS me just getting it done in C++ asap.

There is NO refactoring, tidy up, or other pre-publish work. Just solve the puzzle and commit.

Following AoC github best practice, I will refrain from publishing solutions to the current days puzzle.
